							<h2>Introduction</h2>

							<p>
New languages, which address existing issues in software development, have become preferred choice for many companies. The MEAN development has become the first choice for new and old developers alike. Languages such as AngularJS and NodeJS have made development of client-server applications quicker and easier than ever before and  offer rapid application development.
</p>

							
							<p>
							The purpose of the web was to serve static web pages to clients, but over time needs have changed and this has given rise to numerous technologies, which serve the purpose. From simple forms to web applications like Facebook, the web has become more complex than ever and popular languages such as PHP, JavaScript, and ASP.net have evolved over-time to address growing expectations.
							</p>




<p>
The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how these two technologies  (AngularJS and NodeJS) work in conjunction to accelerate software development and provide comparison with existing traditional approaches to application development.
</p>
<p>
The paper demonstrates the key features of these languages by developing a simple “to-do” app where a user can mange his account and to-do list via the application. The application provides a login interface and currently supports only one user but this can be scaled; the application is meant to demonstrate key concepts of AngularJS and NodeJS.
</p>
<p>
The data for the user is stored in a JSON file; this eliminates the need to set-up a database. A common choice for data storage when working with AngularJS and NodeJS is MongoDB. The paper doesn't provide any details how to use MongoDB in conjunction with AngularJS and NodeJS; the reader is encouraged to investigate how this can be achieved.

							<h2>Chapter I.</h2>
							<h3>What is Angular all about</h3>

							<h4>What was really needed</h4>
							<p>Many frameworks like JQuery, Backbone, and Prototype amongst other exist to accelerate front development but angular brings the much-needed MVC architecture, which enables modern application to be extendable, maintainable, testable and standardized.
							</p>

							<p>Before Angular, jQuery was a popular choice for development projects. Writing code with JQuery, generally, required attaching functions to specific “ids” on the page.  While this approach got the job done, but the code was highly unmaintainable and gave the impression of a “hack”, or code written by a novice programmer; AngularJS was the missing link. </p>

							<h4>What is brings</h4>
							<p><b>MVC (Model View Controller)</b> <br>
							Is a software design pattern, which isolates business logic from interface layer and data. Three components of MVC:</p>

							<table>
							 <tr>
							 	<td><p>Model</p> </td>
							 	<td><p>Primarily the data, is at the lowest level of the pattern </p></td>
							 </tr>
							 <tr>
							 	<td><p>View</p> </td>
							 	<td><p>How to display the data (Model) for the user of the application, primarily presentation of data in a particular format  </p></td>
							 </tr>
							  <tr>
							 	<td><p>Controller</p> </td>
							 	<td><p>Binds Model and View together and controls interactions between the two and applies business logic to the application.
							 		<br/>
								Eg. What to do when user clicks on the table row where data is present.
								</p></td>
							 </tr>
							</table>

							<p><b>Extendable</b><br>
							Angular ships with built-in directives, a directive is functionality, which can be attached to the HTML element to extend its behavior. But Angular also enables programmers to write their own directives, with well-defined functionality.  Initially, programmers had attached functionality to a specific element, for example:</p>

							<table>
								 <thead>
								  <tr>
								     <th><p>jQuery</p></th>
								     <th><p>Angular</p></th>
								  </tr>
								 </thead>
								  <tbody>
									  <tr>
									     <td><pre><code>$(element).datePicker()</code></pre></td>
									     <td><pre><code>&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; date-picker/&gt;</code></pre>

									     				<br><i>or<i><br>
									     	  <pre><code>&lt;date-picker&gt;&lt;/date-picker&gt;</code></pre>


									     </td>
									  </tr>
									 </tbody>
							</table>

							<p>
								When a programmer/designer looks at the mark-up, he/she will have no-clue why the field actually exists and needs to examine existing code just to make sure, if the element actually even has a purpose on the page. But Angular enables meaningful mark-up, none of the existing libraries offered anything like this.<br><br>
								Angular is very flexible when it comes to defining custom-directives and enables programmers to write clean and intuitive code; Angular encourages code 
								reusability and extensibility.
							</p>

							<p><b>Rich Features</b><br>
							Angular brings features like two-way data binding which enables update to view by model and vice-versa. This is very powerful and mimics real-time functionality from the user’s point of view. This power of this feature is clearly seen when a user tries to search a given set of data in the view.
							<br><br>

							Also, Angular enables templating , i.e reusing snippets of HTML anywhere in the application, encouraging code reusability. Generally, a scripting language like PHP handled this where the HTML file had to be turned (renamed) to a PHP file, only to reuse HTML snippets; this seemed like a hack by itself.
							<br><br>
 							Moreover, Angular works very well with forms to handle user-input. Programmers had to use external libraries just to validate and submit forms. Angular plays very well with user-input and provides directives not limited to: ng-dirty,ng-touched,ng-valid amongst other making form handling easy and intuitive. 
 							<br><br>
 							Angular gives power back to programmers to define custom validation rather depending on external libraries.

							<h2>Chapter II.</h2>
							<h3>What makes it different</h3>

							<h4>All-in-one</h4>
							<p>Node is revolution when it comes to writing servers. When it comes to severs, the first name that comes to the mind is PHP.  The equation below, illustrates how Node compares to PHP.</p>
							<p><b>Node.js = PHP + Apache or ASP + IIS stacks.</b></p>


							<p>Node is based on Chrome V8 engine and based on JavaScript, like Angular. This implies front-end and back-end can be based on the same language, limiting the number of languages the developer needs to learn. NodeJS makes the process of writing severs from scratch easier than ever before. Below is the all code needed to needed to write a simple server with Node.
							</p>
							<img src="images/node-server.png" >
							<p>
								The above image illustrates how a simple “Hello, World” server can be set up via Node. The code is intuitive and programmers with little knowledge can explain how the program works.
								<br><br>
								NodeJS is has very quick response time due to it’s non-blocking nature whereas most server-side languages such as PHP are blocking, for example when a user issue to fetches data from database only after data is received, the next line of code is executed; this isn't the case with Node. Node, generally, provides call-back function, which is executed once the action is complete.

							</p>
							<img src="images/node-callback.png" >
							<p>In the above, example the console will output 'finished' before ‘N records returned because the process function is called when all the data has been retrieved. In other words, the program keeps executing while other processes are busy.
							<br><br>
							NodeJS is built on external modules and one popular module is “Express”. The dependency of NodeJS on Express can be compared similar to that of “Ruby on Rails”.
							</p>

							<h2>Chapter III.</h2>
							<h3>What we'll make</h3>

							<p>The code for the project can be found at <a>www.github.com/abs_ed/er</a>. Below is the code structure.</p>

							<table>
								<tr>
									<td><img src="images/code-structure.png" > </td>
									<td> <p>
										The application lies in a folder called “app-de-todo”.
										<br>The static files lie in folder “src” which holds Html/CSS/JavaScript/Images. <br><br>Another folder, “node modules” contains modules, which are used by Node to run the application.
										<br><br>
										The root folder “app-de-todo” holds the file “app.js” which is the starting point for the application.
										<br>This file acts like the “server” for the application and handles incoming requests.
										<br><br>
										The file “data.json” acts like the database for the application.
										<br>All user data is read from the file and changes made by user are saved accordingly.
										<br><br>
										The application has been laid out following the modern web development standards.
										</p>
									 </td>
								</tr>
							</table>

							<p> When the user visits the application, the screen shown below is rendered.</p>

							<img style="border:1px solid grey"src="images/image-render.png" >

					<article class="hs-content" id="chapter4">
						<div class="hs-inner">
							<h2>Chapter IV.</h2>
							<h3>The Beginning</h3>

							<p>Angular/Node work in conjunction to render the application. When the user, hits the address in the browser (url), the server (Node) allows access to “src” folder by using middleware.
							<br><br>
							var bodyParser = require('body-parser') <br>
							app.use(bodyParser.json())<br>
							app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/src')) <br>
							<br><br>
							The file “index.html” is rendered to the user. Contents of the file are shown below.
							<br><br>
							<img src="images/index.png" > <br><br>
							Three important lines that define the application are:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Line 02:   &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot; ng-app=&quot;to-do-app&quot;&gt; </li>
								<li>Line 13:   &lt;script src=&quot;script.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; </li>
								<li>Line 20:   &lt;div ng-view&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  </li>
							</ul>
							<p>
							Line 02, is what defines an angular application, this application is called “to-do-app”. When angular sees the tag “ng-app” it knows that the beginning to the ending tap is the context of the application. In this case &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;, the entire webpage is the angular application.
							</p>
							<p>
							Line 13, the Angular code for the application, more on this later.
							</p>
							<p>
							Line 20, refers to an Angular Directive known an “ng-view”, as name may suggest, this directive controls the “views” for the application.
							</p>

						<div class="hs-inner">
							<h2>Chapter V.</h2>
							<h3>A deeper dive</h3>
							<p>Angular is best known for building “Single-Page-Applications” commonly termed as SPAs. Different views are rendered on the same page to the user via this directive. To the user different pages are being loaded but in reality, it’s just different content (commonly HTML) being placed in the directive; this concept is similar to that of an Ajax call.
							The code for the angular application resides in the file “script.js”. Below is a snippet of the code.
							</p> <br>
							<img src="images/snippet1.png" > <br><br>
							<p>
									In the above snippet, the Angular defines a module “to-do-app”, which is the name of the Angular application. A module can have Controllers, Directives, Config, Services associated with it. All these components make up the Angular Application.<br><br>

									The application has a dependency know as 'ngRoute'. This application depends on a feature of AngularJs which doesn’t ship with Native Angular and needs to imported separately. In the file “index.html”, Line 12 imports the angular-route library.<br><br>

									The ’config’ keyword on line 3, refers to configuration for the application. In brief, what this segment does is to handle routes for the application; the code is analogous human language.
									What to do when user is on a specific route, i.e When the user is on ‘/login’ route then the controller will be ‘FController’ and the template to render will be ‘aut.html’. <br><br>

									By default when the application loads, the user is redirected to ‘/login’ route and up hitting this route, the ‘auth.html’ is rendered, i.e this is the template that replaces content inside: <br><br>

									&lt;div ng-view&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

									<br><br>
									and the controller for this content which lies inside of “div” (contents of file auth.html) will be “FController”

							<h3>The core parts</h3>
							<h4>MVC in practice</h4>
							<table>
								 <thead>
								  <tr>
								     <th><p>View (auth.html)</p></th>
								     <th><p>Controller (FController)</p></th>
								  </tr>
								 </thead>
								  <tbody>
									  <tr>
									     <td><img src="images/view-auth.png" ></td>
									     <td><img src="images/cont-view1.png" ></td>
									  </tr>
								  </tbody>
							</table>
                            <p>
                                As the name suggests, "view" is what is rendered to the user and the controller is what controls the logic behind the view. The view introduces new Angular syntax :
                                "ng-model","ng-click". "ng-model" in a nutshell is what the application wants to model, i.e in a way a variable, the controller knows about and monitors. Any change made to the model
                                is reflected in real-time; this is how Angular achieves the "Data-Binding". <br><br>
                                In the view, we are monitoring what the user types in the HTML text-boxes via the use of "ng-model", any time have access to the content/value of text-boxes via their respective
                                "ng-model" variables. <br><br>
                                Upon entering the requested user-name/password in the text boxes, the clicking of the "Login" button triggers a call to the Angular function "Validate" present in the controller.
                                This function checks if the user-name/password matches a specific combination ('user','pass') and upon success the user is directed to the 'my-list' view  and upon failure the text
                                entered in the text-boxes is cleared.<br><br>
                                The controller, 'FController', depends on a service "$location" whose functionality is similar to the 'Window.Location' in native JavaScript, i.e redirect the user.     
                            </p>
                            <hr>
                            <br>
                            <table>
								 <thead>
								  <tr>
								     <th><p>View (my-list.html)</p></th>
								     <th><p>Controller (FController)</p></th>
								  </tr>
								 </thead>
								  <tbody>
									  <tr>
									     <td><img src="images/view-my-list.png" ></td>
									     <td><img src="images/cont-view2.png" ></td>
									  </tr>
								  </tbody>
							</table>
							<p>
								The purpose of this purpose of this view ('my-list.html') is to render the user's to-do list as well enable user's to edit list by adding,deleting items.
								When the view is rendered, the controller ('MController') issues a call to the server via '$http', line 3, which returns the user's saved to-do list and is 
								saved in the scope variable '$scope.data'.
								<br><br>
								
								In the  front-end the saved to-do list in rendered via the directive <b>'ng-repeat'</b>. This directive is analogous to PHP's <i>'foreach'</i> loop and iterates over the array ('data', this is same '$scope.data') and each item is rendered in the form of list-item '&lt;li&gt;' to the user. <br><br>
								Also the user able to edit his to-do list by adding or deleting items. The user can add new items via text-box to the list and upon clicking the "Insert" 
								button an '$http' call is made to the server and upon successful addition into the data storage, which is the file 'data.json', the inserted item is added to the '$scope.data'.
								<br><br>
								
								Additionally, the user can delete items from his to-do list. When the user clicks on the 'Delete' button, the index of the list-item is passed to controller and the controller issues '$http' call to remove the item by using the index passed and upon successful removal from the 'data.json', the item is also removed from '$scope.data' and hence, user see the selected item being removed form the list.<br><br>

								In the view, the template for navigation 'nav.html' is loaded; this is similar PHP's loading of HTML snippets which are generally, the headers, footers or  navigation common to many HTML files in an application.<br><br>

								Line 3, introduces Angular's powerful feature: <b>'Filters'</b>. As the name suggests, a filter, filters out content. In this case, the Angular's variable 'today' is passed to the filter. The 'date' filter is an in-built Angular's filter and coverts, the input to a specified format and returns its output. Hence, the users views a formatted date, as specified in the filter's configuration.

							</p>
							<hr>
                            <br>

                               <table>
								 <thead>
								  <tr>
								     <th><p>View (my-profile.html)</p></th>

									     <td><img src="images/cont-view3.png" ></td>
									  </tr>
								  </tbody>
							</table>

							<p>
								This view-controller exhibits how easy is it to work with forms in Angular. When the view is loaded, an '$http' call is made to the server to fetch user's 
								personal information and the returned data is saved in the '$scope.profile' which is an object and this is rendered in the UI. The user's name,address,phone is mapped to this object and upon clicking the "Update" button, an '$http' call is made to the server and user profile information is updated and an message in shown to user upon successful update.

							<h2>Chapter VII.</h2>
							<h3>The Data House</h3>
							<h4>Data for the App</h4>
							<p>
								We have seen in previous chapters that Angular makes a call via '$http' and data is exchanged or modified between the front and back-end.
								How is this process being executed ? This chapter answers these questions. Below is structure of the JSON document. <br><br>

										<table>
								<tr>
									<td><img src="images/d-store.png" > </td>
									<td> <p>
										<b>items</b>: An array, holds the user's to-do items <br><br>
										<b>userd</b>: An object, holds user's personal information (fname: Firstname, address: Address, phone: Phone number)
										</p>
									 </td>
								</tr>
							</table>

							 </p>
							 <h4>To-do items</h4>
							  <table>
								 <thead>
								  <tr>
								     <th><p>Node</p></th>
								     <th><p>Angular</p></th>
								  </tr>
								 </thead>
								  <tbody>
									  <tr>
									     <td><img src="images/node-1.png" ></td>
									     <td><img src="images/ang-1.png" ></td>
									  </tr>
								  </tbody>
							</table>
							<p>
								It can been that when Angular issues an <b>get</b> request, Node handles this incoming request and handles it by fetching the contents of the 'data.json'
								file and returns it. The controller which issues the request, catches the returned data and since, it's a JSON document consisting of keys as "items" & "userd", the value of the "items" key is stored in '$scope.data'. The received items in the form of array are rendered in the front-end.
							</p>

							<h4>Delete to-do item</h4>
							  <table>
								 <thead>
								  <tr>
								     <th><p>Node</p></th>
								     <th><p>Angular</p></th>
								  </tr>
								 </thead>
								  <tbody>
									  <tr>
									     <td><img src="images/node-2.png" ></td>
									     <td><img src="images/ang-2.png" ></td>
									  </tr>
								  </tbody>
							</table>
							<p>
								The index of the item to be removed is passed to "Delete" method and a call is issued to remove the associated item from 'data.json'.
								Node receives the index of the item and reads the contents of the JSON file into a local variable.<br><br>
								Since user's items are stored in the "items" array, the index specified is removed and all contents of the local variable, now modified, are 
								saved into 'data.json'. Upon success, the selected 'indexed' item is removed from '$scope.data' and the user sees the selected item being removed from the 
								to-do list.
							</p>

							<h4>Add to-do item</h4>
							  <table>
								 <thead>
								  <tr>
								     <th><p>Node</p></th>
								     <th><p>Angular</p></th>
								  </tr>

								  <tbody>
									  <tr>
									     <td><img src="images/node-3.png" ></td>
									     <td><img src="images/ang-3.png" ></td>
									  </tr>
								  </tbody>
							</table>
							<p>
								The item to be inserted is passed to "Insert" method and a call is issued to add the associated item to the 'data.json'.
								Node receives the item and reads the contents of the JSON file into a local variable.<br><br>
								Since user's items are stored in the "items" array, the item is inserted to this array and the local variable, now modified, is
								saved into 'data.json'. Upon success, the new item is added to '$scope.data' and the user sees the item being added to the 
								to-do list.
							</p>

							<h4>Update profile</h4>
							  <table>
								 <thead>
								  <tr>
								     <th><p>Node</p></th>
								     <th><p>Angular</p></th>
								  </tr>

									     <td><img src="images/ang-4.png" ></td>
									  </tr>
								  </tbody>
							</table>
							<p>
								The object which holds user's info. is passed to the Angular method "Update" and a <b>post</b> request is made. Node upon fetching 
								the request saves the object and replaces value of the "userd" key in the 'data.json' with the passes object and saves the updated user's
								info and an message is displayed to user on success on the operation.

							<h3>Conclusion</h3>
							<h4>What it comes down to</h4>
							<p>
								Although many platforms and languages exist to facilitate web development but the combination of Angular and Node is what was needed for a very long time.
								Angular brings many powerful server side features to front development as illustrated in the paper. Node Js makes writing server side functionality 
								easy and intuitive.<br><br> 
								Both these frameworks are written in JavaScript, this means developers need to know only one language; consequently, making development easier for developers.
